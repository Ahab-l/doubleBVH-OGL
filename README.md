Using TLAS and BLAS significantly enhances the efficiency of ray tracing, especially in large and complex scenes. The ray tracing algorithm first uses the TLAS to quickly determine which BLAS the ray might intersect with, and then it delves deeper into the identified BLAS to check for specific geometry intersections
